Designing efficient and reliable VQA systems remains a challenging problem, more so in the case of disaster management and response systems. In this work, we revisit fundamental combination methods like concatenation, addition and element-wise multiplication with modern image and text feature abstraction models. We design a simple and efficient system which outperforms pre-existing methods on the FloodNet dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This simplified system requires significantly less training and inference time than modern VQA architectures. We also study the performance of various backbones and report their consolidated results.
