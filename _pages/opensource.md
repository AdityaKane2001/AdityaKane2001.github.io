This page summarizes my open source contributions. All of them can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdityaKane2001/).

## TensorFlow

My contributions to TensorFlow include the following [Pull Requests](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+user%3Atensorflow+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues). To summarize, my contributions to this project are as follows:

1. Added "RegNetY" (see below) to TFHub. 
2. Removed few bugs reported by users.
3. Improved documentation.

I also contributed by resolving issues on their GitHub page as well as StackOverflow. 

## Keras

My contributions to Keras include the following [Pull Requests](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+user%3Akeras-team+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues). Most notably, I have added RegNets to `tf.keras.applications`. Check out the PR [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/15702).

## Google Summer of Code 2021 at TensorFlow

My project included implementing and training RegNetY models from the paper **Designing network design spaces** by Radosavovic et al. on ImageNet-1k dataset. The final report is available [here](gsoc2021report). 


## Other projects

I have contributed to small projects like [pytorch-retinanet](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Ayhenon%2Fpytorch-retinanet+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a PyTorch implementation of the  RetinaNet), [SmallPebble](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+user%3Asradc+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a see-through autodiff library written in Python), [awesomo](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Alk-geimfari%2Fawesomo+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a collection of interesting projects).
