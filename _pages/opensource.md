This page summarizes my open source contributions. All of them can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdityaKane2001/).

## KerasCV

KerasCV is a repository of modular building blocks (layers, metrics, losses, data-augmentation) that applied computer vision engineers can leverage to quickly assemble production-grade, state-of-the-art training and inference pipelines. 

My contributions to KerasCV include the following [Pull Requests](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Akeras-team%2Fkeras-cv+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues). Some of the important ones include RandomResizedCrop (a.k.a. Inception crop, Stochastic Depth and porting over models from `keras.applications` to `keras_cv.models`.


## Keras

Keras is Deep learning APT built on top of TensorFlow. Keras offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.

My contributions to Keras include the following [Pull Requests](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Akeras-team%2Fkeras+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues). Most notably, I have added RegNets to `tf.keras.applications`. Check out the PR [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/15702).


## TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. 

My contributions to TensorFlow include the following [Pull Requests](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+user%3Atensorflow+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues). To summarize, my contributions to this project are as follows:

1. Added "RegNetY" (see below) to TFHub. 
2. Removed few bugs reported by users.
3. Improved documentation.

I also contributed by resolving issues on their GitHub page as well as StackOverflow. 


My contributions to Google's ML Ecosystem are recorded in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R-Usj4iRrMDy0OA-x7umNPk5M7gob5Ev_H4wQlxNtcs/edit?usp=sharing).

## Google Summer of Code 2021 at TensorFlow

Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

My project included implementing and training RegNetY models from the paper **Designing network design spaces** by Radosavovic et al. on ImageNet-1k dataset. The final report is available [here](gsoc2021report). 


## Other projects

I have contributed to small projects like [pytorch-retinanet](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Ayhenon%2Fpytorch-retinanet+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a PyTorch implementation of the  RetinaNet), [SmallPebble](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+user%3Asradc+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a see-through autodiff library written in Python), [awesomo](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Alk-geimfari%2Fawesomo+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a collection of interesting projects).
