Hi there! I am Aditya Kane and this website contains my blog posts, publications and projects.
<br>

## A bit about me...

I am a second year master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology in Computer Science with specialization in Machine Learning. 

I am currently working on architecture design and efficiency of vision transformers under the guidance of [Prof. Humphrey Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/home). Prior to that I dabbled in low-resource language models and open set detection in NLP.

I have been the Head Graduate Teaching Assistant for Fall 2023, Spring 2024 and Fall 2024 (ongoing) offerings of Introduction to Computer Vision course at Georgia Tech taught by Prof. Humphrey Shi.

In my spare time, I tend to listen to Indian classical music. 

Feel free to reach out for collaborations. For faster replies, drop an issue in my [profile repo](https://github.com/AdityaKane2001)!
