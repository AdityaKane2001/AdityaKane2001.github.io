Hi there! I am Aditya Kane and this website contains my blog posts, publications and projects.
<br>

## What's new?

ðŸŽ“ Joining Georgia Institute of Technology for Master's in Computer Science this Fall!

## A bit about me...

I am a first year graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology in Computer Science with specialization in Machine Learning.

I am working on problems related to vision and language.

I frequently contribute to the Keras ecosystem. My contributions are aimed towards adding meaningful components that improve user experience, something that Keras stands for. Apart from that, I'm usually squashing nasty bugs in the code. I have summarized my contributions on the "[Open source](https://adityakane2001.github.io/opensource/)" page.

In my spare time, I tend to listen to Indian classical music and play chess. Hit me up if you wanna battle it out on the board!

Feel free to reach out for collaborations. For faster replies, drop an issue in my [profile repo](https://github.com/AdityaKane2001)!
